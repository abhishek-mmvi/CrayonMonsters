CRAYON MONSTERS — PROJECT STATUS REPORT
=======================================
Date: Jan 2026

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
CrayonMonsters is a turn-based PvP game where players draw their own characters. 
The core mechanic is "Creation via Drawing":
1. Player draws a doodle.
2. AI identifies the doodle (e.g., "Dragon").
3. System assigns stats/abilities based on the drawing quality.
4. Players battle using these generated entities.

2. COMPLETED WORK (LAYER 1: VISUAL PERCEPTION)
----------------------------------------------
We have fully implemented the "Eye" of the system. It can see a drawing and understand what it is.

A. The AI Model (doodle_model.h5)
   - Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
   - Input: 28x28 Grayscale images.
   - Output: Probability distribution over ~60 categories (Dragon, Sword, Bridge, etc.).
   - Training Data: Google Quick, Draw! dataset (white strokes on black background).

B. The Dataset Pipeline
   - Implemented a robust pipeline to download, process, and normalize thousands of drawings.
   - Saved as `dataset.npz` (Training/Validation split).
   - Proven reusable: We can add new categories by simply updating `categories.txt` and re-running the script.

C. The "Smart" Inference Engine
   - Problem: Users draw on large, white screens (1440p), but the model expects tiny, black 28px squares.
   - Solution: We built a robust preprocessing pipeline in Python that acts as a translator.
     1. Auto-Crop: Finds the drawing on the huge canvas.
     2. Auto-Contrast: Detects faint pencil lines and boosts them to full visibility.
     3. Inversion: Flips Black-on-White (Paper) to White-on-Black (AI Vision).
   - Result: The model works reliably even with thin lines or large empty spaces.

D. The Drawing UI (Draw Test)
   - A local Web Application (Flask + HTML5 Canvas).
   - Provides a "Perfect" drawing environment with optimized brush sizes (15px) to match the model's training data.
   - Gives instant feedback/predictions.

3. CURRENT STATUS
-----------------
- The project files have been reorganized into the `ImagePredictor/` folder.
- Redundant data files have been identified for deletion to save space.
- The system is online and runnable via `python3 draw_test/backend.py`.

4. PENDING WORK (LAYER 2: GAMEPLAY LOGIC)
-------------------------------------------
This is the next phase. We need to turn the "Label" into "Game Stats".

A. Attribute Configuration (Planned)
   - Design `attributes.json` to define base stats for every creature.
   - Example: Dragon = High Attack, Fire Type. Bridge = High Defense, Structure Type.

B. The "Quality = Power" Engine (Planned)
   - Use the AI's "Confidence Score" as a gameplay mechanic.
   - 99% Confidence ("Perfect Drawing") -> Stat Boosts.
   - 40% Confidence ("Messy Drawing") -> Stat Penalties or Random Mutations.

C. Stat Generator Module (Planned)
   - A Python class `StatGenerator` to perform this math.
   - This will connect the AI backend to the future Game Frontend.

5. SUMMARY
----------
We have successfully built the "Brain" that sees. 
We are now ready to build the "Heart" that gives stats and abilities.
