CREATURE ATTRIBUTES & MOVE GENERATION SYSTEM

(Pokémon-like, LLM-assisted, engine-validated)

 1.⁠ ⁠Core Design Goals

Creatures are generated from hand-drawn characters.

An LLM invents stats, move names, move effects, and descriptions.

The engine enforces rules, order, balance, and legality.

Combat is turn-based and Pokémon-like.

The system must scale to thousands of creatures.

 2.⁠ ⁠Creature Stat System (Fixed & Minimal)

Each creature has exactly five stats.

Authoritative Stat List

hp — health pool

attack — scales damage

defense — reduces damage

speed — determines move order

nature — elemental classification (non-numeric)

Only these five may exist.

 3.⁠ ⁠Nature System (Elemental)

Nature defines elemental identity, not personality.

Allowed Natures

normal

fire

water

electric

earth

air

ice

poison

metal

dark

light

Nature Rules

Nature affects move flavor and bias.

Nature does not directly modify stats or turn order.

Normal is non-elemental and neutral.

 4.⁠ ⁠Move System Overview

Each creature has exactly four moves.

Move Categories

Active — offensive or control

Passive — self-enhancing

Mandatory Rules

At least one active move per creature.

Any mix of active/passive is allowed.

Total moves must equal four.

 5.⁠ ⁠Active Moves

Active moves affect the opponent.

Allowed Active Effects

Damage — raw numerical damage

Stat Debuff — small % reduction to attack, defense, or speed

Skip Turn — chance-based loss of next turn

Restrictions

One effect per move only.

Damage cannot be combined with debuffs or skip.

Values are bounded and small.

 6.⁠ ⁠Passive Moves

Passive moves affect only the user.

Allowed Passive Effects

Percentage-based boosts to:

hp

attack

defense

speed

Restrictions

No damage, debuffs, or control.

One stat per passive move.

Boosts are small and capped.

 7.⁠ ⁠Turn Resolution Order (FINAL & CORRECT)

Turn order is determined in two stages.

Stage 1: Move Category Priority

Active moves always have higher priority than passive moves.

If one creature uses an active move and the other uses a passive move,
→ the active move resolves first, regardless of speed.

Stage 2: Speed Comparison

If both creatures use active moves:

The creature with higher speed acts first.

If both creatures use passive moves:

The creature with higher speed acts first.

Tie-breaking

If speed is equal:

Engine resolves order randomly or via deterministic tie-break rules.

 8.⁠ ⁠Combat Consequences of This Order

Speed is always relevant.

Passive buffs cannot block or preempt attacks.

Active control and damage remain threatening.

Passive play is a long-term investment.

No move can “jump the queue” unfairly.

This mirrors Pokémon intuition while adding clarity.

 9.⁠ ⁠Elemental Consistency Rules

Move names, descriptions, and effects must align with nature.

Normal nature moves are non-elemental.

Elemental creatures should not generate off-theme moves.

Elemental bias examples:

Fire → attack pressure

Ice → speed debuffs

Electric → skip-turn bias

Poison → hp reduction

Earth / Metal → defense manipulation

Normal → reliability and consistency

These are thematic biases, not mechanical bonuses.

10.⁠ ⁠Authority & Validation Model
LLM Responsibilities

Creative generation

Thematic consistency

Variation

Engine Responsibilities

Stat bounds

Move legality

Priority & speed resolution

Probability caps

Regeneration of invalid outputs

The engine is always final.

11.⁠ ⁠Scalability & Future Expansion

The system supports:

Massive procedural generation

Centralized balance tuning

Later addition of:

Type effectiveness

Status durations

Evolutions

PvP modes

Rarity tiers

No core rewrite required.

12.⁠ ⁠Final Design Philosophy

Priority before speed

Speed within category

Creativity without chaos

Rules without ambiguity

Normal nature is deliberate
